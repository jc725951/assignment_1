1. How long did the entire project (assignment 1) take you?
> for this project it took me around 14 days to complete it. This project helps me to learn about functions and how to use them
properly in another functions and to get a proper output as well as it helped me to learn about another new pre-built functions
like capitalize.


2. What do you plan to do  differently in your development process for assignment 2?
> In this project, i get to know about many things that i don't know like i was not able to do formatting properly,
and also got problem in loading files and to print them by splitting. So in next project I want to work on all these aspects
in which i am lacking so that i will be able to work more effectively on next project so that i will be able to
complete it in a good manner.
